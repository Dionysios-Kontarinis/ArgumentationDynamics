ArgumentationDynamics
======================

This project's subject is the **dynamics of abstract argumentation networks**.

Given an abstract argumentation system, and assuming that specific sets of attacks could be added (or removed), we ask the following question:
how to render a specific argument accepted (or rejected), by making a **minimal change** (as far as attack additions and removals are concerned)?

In this work, we propose to encode abstract argumentation systems using the **_Maude language_** and to use the **_Maude rewriting system_**
in order to find every possible way to:

1. Achieve the goal of making a focal argument accepted / rejected.
2. Make minimal structural changes in the initial system. 

The code provided has been used in our research paper **_Rewriting Rules for the Computation of Goal-Oriented
Changes in an Argumentation System_** (**CLIMA'13**).
